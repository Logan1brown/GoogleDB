# Data Entry Implementation Research (Second Analysis)

## Components to Research

### 1. Landing Page Implementation
- How does v2 handle the initial page load?
- What's the exact sequence of operations?
- How is state initialized?

### 2. Search and Fuzzy Logic
- What triggers the search?
- How is the search connected to the form?
- What exactly happens with the results?

### 3. Form State Management
- How are form fields initialized?
- What happens on form submission?
- How does form clearing work?

### 4. Integration Points
- What's the exact flow between components?
- How do state changes propagate?
- What dependencies exist between parts?

## Research Notes

### Landing Page (v2 Implementation)
```python
# To be filled with v2 code analysis
```

### Search Implementation (v2)
```python
# To be filled with v2 code analysis
```

### Form State Management (v2)
```python
# To be filled with v2 code analysis
```

### Integration Analysis
```python
# To be filled after analyzing component interactions
```

## Action Items
1. [ ] Analyze v2's landing page implementation
2. [ ] Study v2's search functionality
3. [ ] Document form state management
4. [ ] Create integration plan
