source_type_success = shows_df.groupby(['source_type', 'network']).size()

# Creative-Network Analysis
creative_network = team_df.groupby(['name', 'network']).size()
repeat_collaborations = team_df.groupby(['name', 'network']).size()[lambda x: x > 1]

# Genre-Creative Analysis
creative_genre = pd.merge(team_df, shows_df[['show_name', 'genre']], on='show_name')
genre_specialization = creative_genre.groupby(['name', 'genre']).size()

# Independent Studio Analysis
independent_studios = shows_df[~shows_df['studio'].isin(conglomerate_studios)]
indep_network_success = independent_studios.groupby(['studio', 'network']).size()
```
