# Data Confidence Analysis

This document ranks our data fields by confidence level and outlines what kinds of analysis we can reliably perform.

## Confidence Levels

### Level 1 (Highest Confidence)
- **Core Fields with Standardized Values**
  - Network
    - Required field
    - Validated against network_list.csv
    - Used in: Market share analysis, network trends
  - Studio
    - Required field
    - Validated against studio_list.csv
    - Used in: Production partnerships, studio patterns
  - Genre (not subgenre)
    - Primary content classification
    - Validated against genre_list.csv
    - Used in: Content strategy analysis
  - Source Type
    - Origin of content (e.g., original, adaptation)
    - Standardized categories
    - Used in: Content sourcing analysis
  - Show Name
    - Primary identifier
    - Unique per entry
    - Used in: Show tracking, team associations

### Level 2 (High Confidence)
- **Team Data**
  - Team Members
    - Creative roles and associations
    - Direct relationship to shows
    - Used in: Creative team analysis, collaboration patterns

### Level 3 (Medium Confidence)
- **Temporal Data**
  - Announcement Dates
    - Key milestone tracking
    - Some inconsistency in entry timing
    - Used in: Timeline analysis (with caveats)

### Level 4 (Lower Confidence)
- **Secondary Classifications**
  - Subgenre
    - More subjective categorization
    - May overlap or change
    - Used in: Detailed content analysis (with caveats)

### Level 5 (Needs Verification)
- **Variable/Changing Data**
  - Status
    - Updates may lag
    - Multiple interpretation points
    - Used in: Current state analysis (needs verification)
  - Order Type
    - Classification may vary
    - Historical inconsistencies
    - Used in: Deal type analysis (needs standardization)
  - Episode Count
    - Subject to change
    - Initial vs. final counts vary
    - Used in: Scale analysis (with major caveats)

## Recommended Analysis Priorities

### Phase 1: Core Pattern Analysis
- Network distribution and market share
- Studio partnerships and specialties
- Primary genre trends by network
- Source type patterns
- Network-Studio-Genre relationships

### Phase 2: Team Composition Analysis
- Creative team structures
- Network/Studio team preferences
- Key talent identification
- Collaboration patterns

### Phase 3: Timeline Analysis (with caveats)
- Announcement patterns
- Development timelines
- Seasonal trends

### Phase 4: Supplementary Analysis
- Subgenre distribution (as supplement to genre analysis)
- Status progression patterns (with verification)
- Order type trends (normalized)
- Episode count patterns (ranges rather than specifics)

## Data Improvement Opportunities
1. Standardize announcement date entry
2. Clarify order type classifications
3. Implement status update protocols
4. Track historical changes in episode counts
5. Document development stage transitions

## Notes
- All temporal analysis should include data completeness warnings
- Cross-reference multiple fields for validation when possible
- Consider implementing confidence scores for derived insights
