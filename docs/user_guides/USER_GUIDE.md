## Important Notes

### Data Entry
- Always use the provided forms and sidebars to add or edit data
- Don't modify the `key_creatives` column directly; it updates automatically
- Use the dropdown menus to ensure consistent data entry

### Sheet Navigation
- All features (Add, Search, Edit) only work when you're on the "shows" sheet
- If you try to use a feature on the wrong sheet, you'll be prompted to switch
- The database uses multiple sheets for different purposes:
  - `shows`: Main data table
  - `show_team`: Team member data
  - Various lookup tables for networks, studios, genres, etc.

### Loading States
- When performing operations, you'll see a loading indicator
- The interface will be temporarily disabled while changes are being processed
- Wait for the operation to complete before making additional changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Feature not working**
   - Make sure you're on the "shows" sheet
   - Try refreshing the page

2. **Team members not showing**
   - Select a row in the shows sheet
   - Try closing and reopening the Edit Team Members sidebar

3. **Dropdowns empty**
   - Check that you're connected to the sheet
   - Refresh the page

## Tips & Tricks

### Keyboard Shortcuts
1. **Quick Navigation**
   - `Ctrl/Cmd + F`: Open search sidebar
   - `Esc`: Close any sidebar
   - Arrow keys: Navigate between cells
   - `Enter`: Select a row

2. **Efficient Data Entry**
   - `Tab`: Move to next field in forms
   - `Shift + Tab`: Move to previous field
   - `Enter`: Submit forms
   - `Esc`: Cancel/close forms

### Best Practices
1. **Working with Team Members**
   - Add team members right after creating a new show
   - Group similar roles together (e.g., all writers, then all producers)
   - Double-check roles before saving

2. **Searching Efficiently**
   - Use partial words to find matches (e.g., "com" for "comedy")
   - Search by studio name to find all shows from a studio
   - Search by network to find all shows on a network

3. **Data Organization**
   - Keep the shows sheet sorted by show name for easier browsing
   - Use filters to quickly find specific categories
   - Regularly check team member assignments for accuracy

## Permissions & Access

### First-Time Access
When you first use the database features, you'll need to:
1. Make sure you have Editor access to the sheet
2. Authorize the database script when prompted
3. Review and accept the permissions the script needs

### Permission Levels
- **Viewers**: Can only view the sheet data
- **Commenters**: Can view and comment on data
- **Editors**: Can use all features including:
  - Adding new shows
