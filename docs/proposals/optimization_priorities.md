# Performance Optimization Priorities

This document outlines optimization opportunities sorted by their effort-to-impact ratio (highest ratio first).

## 1. Quick Wins (High Impact, Low Effort)

### Data Fetching
- [ ] Add `@st.cache_data` to all data loading functions
  - Impact: Immediate performance boost
  - Effort: 1-2 lines per function
  - Notes: Already done for most functions, check for missed ones

### Query Optimization
- [ ] Add indexes on frequently filtered columns
  - Impact: 10x+ speedup for filtered queries
  - Effort: Single SQL command per index
  - Target columns: network_name, status_name, genre_name

### Component Loading
- [ ] Lazy load charts only when tab is active
  - Impact: Faster initial page load
  - Effort: Wrap charts in `if st.session_state.active_tab == 'tab_name'`
  - Note: Already have tab state tracking

## 2. Medium Effort, High Impact

### Materialized Views
- [ ] Add incremental refresh for materialized views
  - Impact: Keep views fresh without full rebuild
  - Effort: Create triggers and refresh logic
  - Target views: api_market_analysis, api_show_details

### Query Batching
- [ ] Combine multiple small queries into single batch
  - Impact: Reduce network round trips
  - Effort: Refactor data fetching logic
  - Focus: Studio and market analysis components

### Session Management
- [ ] Implement proper session cleanup
  - Impact: Prevent memory leaks
  - Effort: Add session lifecycle hooks
  - Note: Critical for production stability

## 3. Long-term Improvements (Higher Effort)

### Caching Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up Redis for shared caching
  - Impact: Better cache hit rates
  - Effort: Significant infrastructure change
  - Note: Only needed with multiple instances

### Data Pagination
- [ ] Add infinite scroll/pagination to large tables
  - Impact: Handle larger datasets
  - Effort: Significant UI/backend changes
  - Note: Not urgent until dataset grows

### Query Optimization
- [ ] Move complex calculations to database functions
  - Impact: Reduce data transfer
  - Effort: Major refactor of analysis logic
  - Target: Market share calculations

## Implementation Notes

### Measuring Impact
1. Use Streamlit's built-in metrics:
   - Page load time
   - Memory usage
   - Cache hit rates

2. Monitor Supabase query performance:
   - Query execution time
   - Row counts
   - Index usage

### Testing Changes
1. Always measure before and after
2. Test with production-size data
3. Test with simulated concurrent users

### Priority Updates
This list should be reviewed and updated as:
1. New performance bottlenecks are discovered
2. Usage patterns change
3. Data volume grows
