# GoogleDB Project Retrospective

## Data Model Achievements

### Core Entities Mapped
1. Shows
   - Primary key: 'shows' column in shows sheet
   - Foreign key: 'show_name' in show_team sheet
   - Key metrics: success_score, tmdb_rating
   - Linked to: studios, networks, team members

2. Studios
   - Categories: Independent,Large | Independent,Mid-Size
   - Relationships: Many-to-many with shows
   - Key metrics: show_count, network_relationships
   - Aliases system implemented for variant names

3. Networks
   - Direct relationships with shows
   - Success metrics per network
   - Genre distribution tracking
   - Cross-network show sharing analysis

### Validated Business Rules
1. Studio Classification
   - Independent studio identification using startswith('Independent')
   - Studio size categories from studio_list sheet
