It stars nine characters from the DreamWorks Animation animated film Madagascar: The penguins Skipper, Kowalski, Private, and Rico; the lemurs King Julien, Maurice, and Mort; and Mason and Phil the chimpanzees. Characters new to the series include Marlene the otter and a zookeeper named Alice. It is the first Nicktoon produced with DreamWorks Animation.\n\nA pilot episode, \"Gone in a Flash\", aired as part of \"Superstuffed Nicktoons Weekend\" on November 29, 2008, and The Penguins of Madagascar became a regular series on March 28, 2009. The series premiere drew 6.1 million viewers, setting a new record as the most-watched premiere.\n\nAlthough the series occasionally alludes to the rest of the franchise, The Penguins of Madagascar does not take place at a precise time within it. McGrath, who is also the co-creator of the film characters, has said that the series takes place \"not specifically before or after the movie, I just wanted them all back at the zoo. I think of it as taking place in a parallel universe.\"", "first_air_date": "2008-11-28", "genre_ids": [], "popularity": 55.8559, "vote_average": 7.4, "vote_count": 378, "genres": [{"id": 16, "name": "Animation"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Comedy"}], "networks": [{"id": 13, "name": "Nickelodeon"}], "status": "Ended", "type": "Scripted", "number_of_seasons": 3, "number_of_episodes": 149, "in_production": false, "languages": ["en"], "last_air_date": "2013-02-28"}}
