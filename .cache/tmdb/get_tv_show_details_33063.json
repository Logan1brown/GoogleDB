It was an onslaught that killed nearly three thousand people - but a decade later, the attack isn't over. The dust that overwhelmed the streets of Lower Manhattan became a weapon. The clouds contained particles of pulverized concrete, asbestos, lead from fifty thousand computers, mercury from countless light bulbs -- a million tons of poisonous fallout. Now nearly 20,000 people are receiving treatment for a range of illnesses, many of them serious. And more than 60,000 are registered as at risk. The BBC Our World team first broke the story globally in 2006. They return 5 years later to investigate a worsening tragedy and followup with those who shared their stories.", "first_air_date": null, "genre_ids": [], "popularity": 0.0629, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "genres": [], "networks": [], "status": "Ended", "type": "Scripted", "number_of_seasons": 0, "number_of_episodes": 0, "in_production": false, "languages": [], "last_air_date": null}}
