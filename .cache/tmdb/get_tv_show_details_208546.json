The series of technological innovations carried out by Wei Cheng catches the young industrial workers, represented by welder Jin Yanzi, by surprise. They not only have to learn new skills such as programming, they also have to \"face off\" with the digital R&D team under Wei Cheng's leadership.\n\nWei Cheng is disheartened upon learning that Lushan Heavy Industry had used the funds he raised to purchase production equipment for social security payments instead. From constant conflicts to an adjustment period, from the initial rejection to acceptance, Wei Cheng is influenced by the unyielding enthusiasm of the workers.
