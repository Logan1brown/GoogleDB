Living in the countryside, he took in three common people as his disciples, among whom he looked at Ying Ziyang (Xiao Yulong) with special eyes. On the other hand, with the help of his aide Duan Ronglu (Wang Wei), Huan usurped his father and killed his uncle. He became known as the \"God of War\" and succeeded to the throne. At the same time, Yu was shocked to hear that his father had passed away and went to Beijing to attend the funeral. He then exposed the evil deeds of Huan and Duan Ronglu, and the brothers turned against each other. Yu was even more miserable and was deprived of his martial arts skills. In the end, Yu pinned all his hopes on Yang and regarded him as his adopted son, and he and Huan then pursued the name of God of War.", "first_air_date": "1985-01-01", "genre_ids": [], "popularity": 5.4422, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "genres": [{"id": 18, "name": "Drama"}], "networks": [{"id": 461, "name": "ATV"}], "status": "Ended", "type": "Scripted", "number_of_seasons": 1, "number_of_episodes": 25, "in_production": false, "languages": ["cn"], "last_air_date": "1985-01-01"}}
