Unfortunately, little Sonya's trained assassin instincts often work against her and others in her daily high school life, as Yasuna's often-broken wrist can attest to. She just wanted a hug, but she ended up with a broken neck. Isn't it sad? No, it's hilarious.", "first_air_date": "2012-01-05", "genre_ids": [], "popularity": 2.3202, "vote_average": 6.7, "vote_count": 27, "genres": [{"id": 16, "name": "Animation"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Comedy"}], "networks": [{"id": 94, "name": "MBS"}, {"id": 201, "name": "CBC"}, {"id": 881, "name": "BS-TBS"}, {"id": 160, "name": "TBS"}], "status": "Ended", "type": "Scripted", "number_of_seasons": 1, "number_of_episodes": 13, "in_production": false, "languages": ["ja"], "last_air_date": "2012-03-29"}}
