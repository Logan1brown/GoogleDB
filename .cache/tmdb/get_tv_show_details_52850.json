They are cursed to compel their current owners to repeat the original murders. The curse also makes them indestructible. Kiri Haimura is the current owner of a pair of shears that can cut seemingly anything, although the only thing he wants to cut is hair. One day he meets Iwai Mushanokoji, a girl of whom he has only heard rumors that her hair cannot be cut, a girl who can grant one wish, any wish, but only to the person who murders her. Every morning he cuts her hair, which grows back every night; and every day he helps protect her from people who know about her curse and who want a wish granted.", "first_air_date": "2013-04-04", "genre_ids": [], "popularity": 2.0833, "vote_average": 7.403, "vote_count": 36, "genres": [{"id": 16, "name": "Animation"}, {"id": 10759, "name": "Action & Adventure"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Comedy"}], "networks": [{"id": 817, "name": "Sun TV"}, {"id": 614, "name": "Tokyo MX"}], "status": "Ended", "type": "Scripted", "number_of_seasons": 1, "number_of_episodes": 13, "in_production": false, "languages": ["ja"], "last_air_date": "2013-06-27"}}
