The victims included three people from one family and a child from another. Eventually, a nurse quickly saw a common thread between the deaths; the victims all took the common pain reliever Tylenol, but their capsules were laced with cyanide. The deaths were soon dubbed the \"Tylenol Murders\" and started a frenzy to find the person responsible as fear spread across the country and store owners pulled Tylenol from their shelves.", "first_air_date": "2023-10-10", "genre_ids": [99, 80], "popularity": 0.705, "vote_average": 3.5, "vote_count": 2}]}
