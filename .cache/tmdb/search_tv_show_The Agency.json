The series was created by Michael Frost Beckner and was executive produced by Michael Frost Beckner, Shaun Cassidy Productions and Radiant Productions in association with Universal Network Television and CBS Productions. It aired from September 27, 2001 until May 17, 2003, lasting two seasons. It featured unprecedented filming from the actual CIA headquarters.\n\nThe show was controversial regarding its exploration of current international affairs and its treatment of the ethical conflicts inherent in intelligence work. Beckner's pilot script, written in March 2001, posited a re-invented CIA tasked with a \"War on Terror\" after Osama Bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist organization plots a lethal attack on the west. The pilot was to premiere at CIA Headquarters on September 18, 2001 and set to air on CBS September 21, 2001, however, the actual 9/11 attacks convinced the network to hold the pilot and instead air a later episode. That first episode was aired later as the third episode of the first season.\n\nThe September 11, 2001 terrorist events changed the way Americans viewed topical entertainment and \"The Agency\", at the time, was one of the most topical offering on network television. The producers of the series quickly responded to this new American perspective on world affairs, but CBS chose to cancel the show shortly after the second season's final episode.", "first_air_date": "2001-09-27", "genre_ids": [18], "popularity": 6.353, "vote_average": 6.8, "vote_count": 11}, {"id": 219971, "name": "The Agency", "original_name": "The Agency", "overview": "Covert CIA agent Martian is ordered to abandon his undercover life and return to London Station.

The show completed four seasons, through which it followed the self-proclaimed world's first supermodel Janice Dickinson as she took on the role of a modeling agent to her own eponymous agency, also called The Janice Dickinson Modeling Agency, which opened for business in November 2005.\n\nThe first season follows her opening of the agency, including the difficulty in finding models of Janice's vision, getting them proficient in front of the camera, obtaining financial backing and establishing a reputation for her agency. Subsequent seasons followed the development of the agency and a constantly changing cast of models. A number of the male models are openly gay, and a number of the agency's clients are gay-oriented businesses. This resulted in many of the episodes being gay-themed.\n\nOxygen aired a one-hour holiday special to bridge a gap between the first and second seasons, entitled Christmas with the Dickinsons.\n\nIn the UK, there was to be a British version of the show with supermodel Paula Hamilton as the agency head. Like the American version, the show was to be titled after the lead. It was to be shown on the cable channel Living, which is also the home of the Top Model franchise in UK.
