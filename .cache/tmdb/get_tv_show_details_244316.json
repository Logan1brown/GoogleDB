Both the bandits and the police turn to magic for self-protection. Two brothers are separated as children and thrown into two different worlds \u2013 the dark, seedy world of the bandits and the other under the wing of the lawman, only to be reunited years later as enemies, where circumstances force them to fight each other, but for the same cause - to right the wrong and avenge the death of their father. Krathing, a vigilante in an officer's uniform, is the rival of Mai, a saint in bandit garb who steals from the rich and gives to the poor. They fight not only for their duty, but also for the heart of Kamlai, the woman they both desire.
