But what should have been a time of rejoicing soon turned into a period of overwhelming grief as Zu Wang\u2019s wife slipped quietly from this world. Now left to raise his five children alone, Zu Wang\u2019s true colors were revealed. Selfish and unfeeling, Zu Wang turned all of his focus inward, leaving his children to fend for themselves.
