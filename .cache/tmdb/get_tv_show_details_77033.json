The show has drawn keen attention for the combination between iKON and Jung Hyung-don. As iKON members have never gone on a school trip because of their busy schedules as an idol group, the members look very much excited about their first school trip in the show.\n\nThe show is also a project designed to build friendship between Korean and Japanese stars. Along with the iKON members who will appear as the students of \u201cPresident Yang\u2019s High School\u201d, seven Japanese rising stars will appear as the students of \u201cTokyo Girls\u2019 High School\u201d. The seven include members of Japanese girl group GEM of AVEX, one of the largest music labels in Japan, as well as top actresses and models on Japan.", "first_air_date": "2017-11-05", "genre_ids": [], "popularity": 0.9886, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "genres": [{"id": 10764, "name": "Reality"}], "networks": [{"id": 885, "name": "JTBC"}], "status": "Ended", "type": "Reality", "number_of_seasons": 1, "number_of_episodes": 6, "in_production": false, "languages": ["ko"], "last_air_date": "2017-12-10"}}
