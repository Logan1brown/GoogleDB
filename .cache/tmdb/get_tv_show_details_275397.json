Their ancestors lived on Earth 18 million years ago. It was a small, forest-dwelling mammal - and in the course of evolution, this little antelope became the direct ancestor of the now-extinct turo. The human hunter who pursued these ungulates became the herder - and eventually evolved the ox, zebu, buffalo or whatever...
