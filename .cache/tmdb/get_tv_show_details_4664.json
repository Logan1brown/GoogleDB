The game starts at 7pm ET, following SportsCenter, and usually lasts around three hours with an hour long Baseball Tonight following the game leading up to the 11pm ET SportsCenter. The official name is ESPN Wednesday Night Baseball presented by Captain Morgan. Every April some broadcasts air on ESPN2 due to ESPN's priority with Wednesday's NBA coverage.\n\nWednesday Night Baseball is not exclusive to ESPN. Local sports networks may still air the game. ESPNEWS is seen on ESPN during the game in the teams' designated markets, unless local broadcasters choose not to televise the game. ESPN's blackout can be lifted in the latter scenario. On double-headers in September, due to the broadcast of Monday Night Football, either one of the Wednesday Night Baseball games will co-exist with the local markets' carriers and will not always be subject to blackout.", "first_air_date": null, "genre_ids": [], "popularity": 0.0239, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "genres": [], "networks": [{"id": 29, "name": "ESPN"}], "status": "Ended", "type": "Scripted", "number_of_seasons": 0, "number_of_episodes": 0, "in_production": false, "languages": ["en"], "last_air_date": null}}
