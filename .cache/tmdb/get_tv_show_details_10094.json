The series was produced by Savannah Productions, Inc., Hanncar Productions, Inc., and 20th Century-Fox Television.\n\nDuring pre-production, the proposed series title was Mama's Man. The series was also unique in that it was among the few situation comedies in the late 1960s that did not use a laugh track; however, 20th Century-Fox Television added them when the series was reissued for syndication and cable rebroadcasts in the late 1980s.", "first_air_date": "1968-09-17", "genre_ids": [], "popularity": 3.503, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 8, "genres": [{"id": 35, "name": "Comedy"}], "networks": [{"id": 6, "name": "NBC"}], "status": "Ended", "type": "Scripted", "number_of_seasons": 3, "number_of_episodes": 86, "in_production": false, "languages": ["en"], "last_air_date": "1971-03-23"}}
