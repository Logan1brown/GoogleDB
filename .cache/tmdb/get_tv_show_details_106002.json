Due to that, Aoi usually takes a long time in her consultations with the patients, and this causes her to be complained by her colleagues for being too inefficient in her work. Aoi shrugs off the complaints as her goal is to help the patients regain the daily life that they once took for granted.", "first_air_date": "2020-07-16", "genre_ids": [], "popularity": 1.3221, "vote_average": 7.6, "vote_count": 5, "genres": [{"id": 18, "name": "Drama"}], "networks": [{"id": 1, "name": "Fuji TV"}], "status": "Ended", "type": "Scripted", "number_of_seasons": 1, "number_of_episodes": 11, "in_production": false, "languages": ["ja"], "last_air_date": "2020-09-24"}}
