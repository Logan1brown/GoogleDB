These PSAs are broadcast regularly during NBC's programming in primetime, late night, and Saturday morning.\n\nThe spots feature personalities from various NBC shows. Tom Brokaw was the first person to do a The More You Know spot; it aired on NBC in September 1989.\n\nThe first 'comet trail' star logo was created by Paul Johnson on an animation stand using a slit scan technique at R/Greenberg Associates in Manhattan. They were later updated using three-dimensional computer graphics.\n\nIn 2010 and 2011, US President Barack Obama participated in the campaign, encouraging parents to be more involved in their children's education. Several past presidents have also participated, including President Bill Clinton and President George H. W. Bush.\n\n\"El Poder de Saber\" is The More You Know's sister campaign on Telemundo. While the other U.S. broadcast networks have similar campaigns, namely CBS Cares and ABC's A Better Community, The More You Know is likely the most well known.", "first_air_date": "1989-09-09", "genre_ids": [], "popularity": 0.1432, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "genres": [{"id": 10751, "name": "Family"}], "networks": [{"id": 6, "name": "NBC"}], "status": "Ended", "type": "Scripted", "number_of_seasons": 1, "number_of_episodes": 1, "in_production": false, "languages": ["en"], "last_air_date": "1989-09-09"}}
