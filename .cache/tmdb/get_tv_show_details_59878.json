And Memory Bus Route. And Memory Bike Path. Julia and her guest will make their way from the seat of childhood memories, the family home, through the surrounding neighbourhood and all the way to the school gate, reliving formative moments, talking about life, love and achievement, about the past, present and future. What Julia discovers about her guests will explain, well, almost everything. Time-travelling guests Carl Barron, Noeline Brown, John Safran, Alan Brough and Shane Jacobson will share with Julia where they stacked their first bike, stole their first kiss and learned the art of a withering comeback.", "first_air_date": "2013-09-18", "genre_ids": [], "popularity": 15.6834, "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 1, "genres": [{"id": 35, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 99, "name": "Documentary"}], "networks": [{"id": 18, "name": "ABC TV"}], "status": "Ended", "type": "Documentary", "number_of_seasons": 9, "number_of_episodes": 77, "in_production": false, "languages": ["en"], "last_air_date": "2022-07-10"}}
