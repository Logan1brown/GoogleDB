She does not perform well in school, but loves to draw, and wants to be a manga artist. Her family runs a flower shop so she has grown up with a floral appreciation. Yumi is a very good artist, but does not always use the best judgement when she chooses her subjects. On the day of the Flower Festival, she entertains the other children by drawing portraits of the Lady Fukurokouji on the walls of her mansion. An angry Fukurokouji makes her clean the entire wall, but as she is doing so, she sees Fukurokouji about to destroy a dandelion. After saving it, she replants it in a tulip field. To her surprise, it starts speaking to her. The voices belong to Kakimaru and Keshimaru, two flower elves who have come to the Human World to grant Yumi special powers as a reward for her kindness.", "first_air_date": "1986-03-07", "genre_ids": [], "popularity": 4.5606, "vote_average": 4.0, "vote_count": 2, "genres": [{"id": 16, "name": "Animation"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 10765, "name": "Sci-Fi & Fantasy"}], "networks": [{"id": 57, "name": "Nippon TV"}], "status": "Ended", "type": "Scripted", "number_of_seasons": 1, "number_of_episodes": 25, "in_production": false, "languages": ["ja"], "last_air_date": "1986-08-29"}}
