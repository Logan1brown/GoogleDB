Close to Amsterdam, in one of the world's most densely populated countries, on a piece of land that was under water forty years ago, a nature reserve of international allure has developed. A unique experiment is taking place here: nature is allowed to run its course. The result of this is an untouched piece of wilderness in the reclaimed Flevopolder. It differs from all other Dutch landscapes. Internationally, this piece of nature below sea level is rare. It is used worldwide as an example of the development of new visions of nature and the role of people in it. For many, this area is unknown, because most of it is not open to the public.", "first_air_date": "2013-12-11", "genre_ids": [], "popularity": 0.4094, "vote_average": 10.0, "vote_count": 1, "genres": [{"id": 99, "name": "Documentary"}], "networks": [{"id": 760, "name": "VARA"}], "status": "Ended", "type": "Documentary", "number_of_seasons": 1, "number_of_episodes": 3, "in_production": false, "languages": ["en", "nl"], "last_air_date": "2013-12-25"}}
