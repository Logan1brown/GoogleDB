I\u2019m Afraid of Virginia Woolf", "overview": "Me - I'm Afraid of Virginia Woolf is a 1978 television play by Alan Bennett, produced by London Weekend Television and directed by Stephen Frears.\n\nIt tells the story of Trevor, a teacher of English Literature to adults in the evenings. Trevor is not a happy man; his girlfriend gets her hair in her muesli, someone has vandalised his visual aids for his evening classes; drawing a large pair of breasts on his poster of Virginia Woolf and a big cigar in the mouth of E M Forster on the other; he suffers from 'curate's bladder' and is unable to urinate if there is another man present in the toilet; and he does not even like his name - Trevor. Most of his students are hopeless but there is one bright working-class man in the class. After an unpleasant evening during which he gets punched in the face he meets the bright student, Skinner by chance. Skinner addresses him as 'Trev' and this cheers him up greatly, making him seeing himself in a new light. It is hinted that there will be a future gay romance between Trevor and Skinner.\n\nThe title of the play is a parody of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, which in turn plays on the title of the Disney song \"Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?\"", "first_air_date": null, "genre_ids": [], "popularity": 0.0143, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "genres": [], "networks": [], "status": "Ended", "type": "Scripted", "number_of_seasons": 0, "number_of_episodes": 0, "in_production": false, "languages": [], "last_air_date": null}}
