A day later, the body of the prime suspect - the family\u2019s 45-year-old Nepalese help - is discovered on the terrace of the same flat. Who wanted them dead and why?\n\n5 \u00bd years later, a Trial Court sentences Aarushi\u2019s parents to life imprisonment. It becomes one of India\u2019s most controversial verdicts. \"Aarushi \u2013 Beyond Reasonable Doubt\" is a 4-part documentary series that reopens the Aarushi Case diaries to separate fact from fiction. The murders. The motive. The media. The murder weapon. The blood on the stairs.\n\nThe series draws on the voices of investigators, lawyers, family and friends, crucial witnesses, and journalists who give their versions of truth. It pitches the prosecution against the defence, and the believers against the skeptics. Produced in over more than one year, what emerges is a fascinating story of loss, anger, rivalry, helplessness, justice and retribution.", "first_air_date": "2017-10-23", "genre_ids": [], "popularity": 0.2257, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "genres": [{"id": 99, "name": "Documentary"}], "networks": [], "status": "Ended", "type": "Documentary", "number_of_seasons": 1, "number_of_episodes": 4, "in_production": false, "languages": ["en", "hi"], "last_air_date": "2017-10-23"}}
