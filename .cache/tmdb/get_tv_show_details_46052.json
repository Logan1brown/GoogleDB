The harsh environment at the hospitals led many doctors to retire from their positions, forcing hospitals to make use of said program to fill the empty spots at least temporary. However, Michiko doesn\u2019t look like a doctor at all with her flashy clothes and eccentric attitude. In the first episode she raises objections to a certain operation which is planned to be done by the head of a hospital who hasn\u2019t performed an operation for a very long time. This causes Michiko to incur odium at the hospital, however, everyone becomes frozen when Michiko points out the outdated skills of the director. She also holds a scrupulous compliance when it comes to her working hours, never does any unnecessary chores that don\u2019t require a medical license, and couldn\u2019t care less about the power struggles within the hospitals. Nobody knows how she acquired such a top-level skill that allows her to claim exorbitant sums as reward, but her private life is an even greater mystery to everyone around her. Tanaka plays a rookie surgeon, Uchida an anesthetist, Kishibe the head of the placement service, and Ito the head of the surgical department of this institution.", "first_air_date": "2012-10-18", "genre_ids": [], "popularity": 11.0347, "vote_average": 7.4, "vote_count": 29, "genres": [{"id": 18, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 9648, "name": "Mystery"}], "networks": [{"id": 103, "name": "tv asahi"}], "status": "Ended", "type": "Scripted", "number_of_seasons": 7, "number_of_episodes": 69, "in_production": false, "languages": ["ja"], "last_air_date": "2021-12-16"}}
