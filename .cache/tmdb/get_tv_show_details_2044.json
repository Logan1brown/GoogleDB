Since there was a Power Spot that released the magical power in the community, the people were distressed by the threat of the demon army Jamanga who are gathering Minus Energy (\u30de\u30a4\u30ca\u30b9\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc Mainasu Enerug\u012b) from the frightened masses for a sinister purpose. The secret organization S.H.O.T. was formed to protect the people of the community from the Jamanga, concealing their existence as ordinary members of the Akebono Police Station, which considers demons beyond their jurisdiction.
