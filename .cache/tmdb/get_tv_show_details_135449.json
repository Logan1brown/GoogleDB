If you don\u2019t make it, you don\u2019t want it. That\u2019s simply who she is. Tina lives for her three children\n\n\u2013 at least since she kicked her husband out. Now they are on their own. And now, of all times, her boss, the baker, gives her notice. No, Tina is\n\nnot a baker. Tina is mobile. A saleswoman. With her mobile bakery, she went to all the small villages north of Berlin that don\u2018t have a bakery\n\nor grocery store. Tina unemployed? No. Not her thing. Tina goes into business for herself. Tina has a plan for each of her three brats, a master plan, so\n\nto speak. The only thing that always gets in the way is life... but one thing is for sure: Tina refuses to give up!", "first_air_date": "2021-09-16", "genre_ids": [], "popularity": 0.2713, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "genres": [{"id": 18, "name": "Drama"}], "networks": [{"id": 308, "name": "Das Erste"}], "status": "Ended", "type": "Miniseries", "number_of_seasons": 1, "number_of_episodes": 6, "in_production": false, "languages": ["de"], "last_air_date": "2021-09-16"}}
