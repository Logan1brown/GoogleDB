Both of her parents are in their seventies and a 20-plus age difference exists between Ro-ra and her three other male siblings - Wang-sung, Geum-sung and Soo-sung. As the youngest child of a wealthy family, Ro-ra is charming, uber-confident and seemingly a spoiled material girl, but there's more to her than meets the eye. Unafraid to speak her mind, she intervenes to salvage her 50-year-old second brother's marriage by getting rid of his mistress who had lied about getting pregnant. One day, she falls head over heels for Hwang Ma-ma, an irritable novelist and perfectionist.
