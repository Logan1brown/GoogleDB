The first round masters the basics and challenges the competitors to re-create one of Julia's signature dishes, with some guidance from Julia herself, as seen on a giant television screen in the middle of the action. Round 2 is an ode to Julia, where competitors must take inspiration from Julia to create a unique dish reflecting their own culinary point of view. Dishes from the second round are served family-style, with competitors and judges sampling each dish and sharing stories about their food journeys and personal connection to Julia. Antonia Lofaso and a rotating panel of guest judges will decide which of the competitors wins the life-changing grand prize that literally follows in Julia's footsteps: an all-expense paid three-month cooking course at Le Cordon Bleu.", "first_air_date": "2022-03-14", "genre_ids": [], "popularity": 0.132, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "genres": [{"id": 10764, "name": "Reality"}], "networks": [{"id": 143, "name": "Food Network"}], "status": "Returning Series", "type": "Reality", "number_of_seasons": 1, "number_of_episodes": 6, "in_production": true, "languages": ["en"], "last_air_date": "2022-04-18"}}
