The victims included three people from one family and a child from another. Eventually, a nurse quickly saw a common thread between the deaths; the victims all took the common pain reliever Tylenol, but their capsules were laced with cyanide. The deaths were soon dubbed the \"Tylenol Murders\" and started a frenzy to find the person responsible as fear spread across the country and store owners pulled Tylenol from their shelves.", "first_air_date": "2023-10-10", "genre_ids": [], "popularity": 0.6805, "vote_average": 3.5, "vote_count": 2, "genres": [{"id": 99, "name": "Documentary"}, {"id": 80, "name": "Crime"}], "networks": [{"id": 4330, "name": "Paramount+"}], "status": "Ended", "type": "Miniseries", "number_of_seasons": 1, "number_of_episodes": 5, "in_production": false, "languages": ["en"], "last_air_date": "2023-10-10"}}
