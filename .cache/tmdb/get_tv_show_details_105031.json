The two hour-long specials were filmed as part of Gaffigan's The Pale Tourist worldwide tour, in which he traveled the world--in each country meeting people, eating the food, and learning a bit about the history. He would then transform those experiences into a stand-up set of all-new material and perform it for locals and expatriates, before heading on to another destination and doing it all over again.", "first_air_date": "2020-07-24", "genre_ids": [], "popularity": 0.5283, "vote_average": 5.6, "vote_count": 19, "genres": [{"id": 35, "name": "Comedy"}], "networks": [{"id": 1024, "name": "Prime Video"}], "status": "Canceled", "type": "Scripted", "number_of_seasons": 1, "number_of_episodes": 2, "in_production": false, "languages": ["en"], "last_air_date": "2020-07-24"}}
