The principle is simple: a stage, an audience, and true stories.\n\nBy inviting people to come and tell their personal stories, the Moth has several goals: to share unforgettable stories, of course, but also to meet others, to be inspired by their journey, to discover their experiences, their visions, their doubts, their dreams. Dissolving barriers, at a time when it is more and more necessary.
