They are cursed to compel their current owners to repeat the original murders. The curse also makes them indestructible. Kiri Haimura is the current owner of a pair of shears that can cut seemingly anything, although the only thing he wants to cut is hair. One day he meets Iwai Mushanokoji, a girl of whom he has only heard rumors that her hair cannot be cut, a girl who can grant one wish, any wish, but only to the person who murders her. Every morning he cuts her hair, which grows back every night; and every day he helps protect her from people who know about her curse and who want a wish granted.", "first_air_date": "2013-04-04", "genre_ids": [16, 10759, 35], "popularity": 2.0833, "vote_average": 7.403, "vote_count": 36}, {"id": 104788, "name": "Severe Winter", "original_name": "\u5bd2\u51ac", "overview": "", "first_air_date": "2015-03-26", "genre_ids": [18, 10768], "popularity": 4.8884, "vote_average": 5.0, "vote_count": 1}, {"id": 48477, "name": "Several Questions That Makes Us Happy", "original_name": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub97c \ud589\ubcf5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uba87\uac00\uc9c0 \uc9c8\ubb38", "overview": "", "first_air_date": null, "genre_ids": [], "popularity": 0.0441, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0}, {"id": 123168, "name": "Several Years Later", "original_name": "\u0628\u0639\u062f \u0639\u062f\u0629 \u0633\u0646\u0648\u0627\u062a", "overview": "", "first_air_date": "2021-04-13", "genre_ids": [], "popularity": 0.062, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0}]}
