# Status [2025-03-31T02:04]

Progress: (task tracking)
- Previous: Implemented network-genre layered filtering
- Current: Documenting and organizing changes
- Next: Improve layout and UX of network filter

Implementation: (current focus)
- Network Connections Dashboard improvements:
  1. Completed Features:
     - Tabbed interface (Network Filter, Success Stories)
     - Layered filtering pattern (Network + Genre)
     - Scrollable results with progressive disclosure
  2. Next Improvements:
     - Adjust filter column widths and spacing
     - Fix vertical alignment of filter headers
     - Balance expandable result spacing

Working files: (ONLY 3 current files)
1. src/dashboard/components/connections_view.py (active development)
2. docs/analysis/STS_ANALYSIS_FRAMEWORK.md (updated)

Reference docs: (current task best practices)
- docs/development/STYLE_GUIDE.md (visualization standards)
- docs/analysis/STS_ANALYSIS_FRAMEWORK.md (layered filtering pattern)
- README.md (updated)

Specs: (current task requirements)
- Maintain clear primary/secondary filter hierarchy
- Use expandable sections for detailed info
- Smart show listing (3 or fewer)
- Consider performance with large result sets

Insights: (new patterns discovered)
- Layered filtering powerful for complex queries
- Primary (required) + Secondary (optional) pattern works well
- Could extend to genre + source views
- Progressive disclosure helps manage information density
