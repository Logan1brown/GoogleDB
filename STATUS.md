# Status [2025-04-04T02:16]

Progress: (task tracking)
- Previous: Network Connections Dashboard Refactor
- Current: Stabilizing Core Components
- Next: Success Analyzer Component Design

## Current Status

### Completed
- Fixed Network Connections Dashboard
  - Resolved NoneType error in creator profiles
  - Stabilized heatmap and filter functionality
  - Refactored ConnectionsAnalyzer initialization
  - Fixed creator profiles data structure

- Improved Market View
  - Implemented success score metrics
  - Added success rate filtering
  - Refactored data loading and validation
  - Enhanced hover text with network metrics

### In Progress
- Error Handling & Performance
  - Adding error logging for data loading/merging
  - Implementing loading states for data processing
  - Optimizing large result set handling

### Next Steps
1. Enhance User Experience
   - Add tooltips and help text
   - Improve layout and spacing
   - Add progressive loading for large datasets

2. Success Analyzer Integration
   - Design centralized success metrics
   - Plan integration with existing analyzers
   - Consider cross-component data sharing

Implementation: (current focus)
- Robust error handling
- Performance optimization
- User experience improvements

Working files: (ONLY 4 current files)
2. src/dashboard/templates/defaults/*.py (chart defaults)
3. src/dashboard/templates/grids/*.py (layout grids)
4. src/dashboard/utils/style_config.py (style constants)
5. src/dashboard/components/market_snapshot.py (first component)

Reference docs: (current task best practices)
1. docs/development/STYLE_GUIDE.md (visual standards)
2. docs/development/TEMPLATE_SYSTEM.md (architecture)
3. README.md (project structure)

Specs: (current task requirements)
1. Three-layer visualization system:
   - Base Template Layer (go.layout.Template)
   - Grid Layout Layer (make_subplots)
   - Style Config Layer (style_config.py)
2. Consistent styling:
   - Typography: Source Sans Pro
   - Colors: Defined in style_config.py
   - Layout: Full width, proper spacing

Insights: (new patterns discovered)
1. Template hierarchy ensures consistency
2. Grid system separates structure from style
3. Preview system validates layouts early

Rules: (global working limits)
- Plan refactor if file > 500 lines
- Analyze full context before modifying
- Always view before editing
- ACTIVE REQUEST: MUST return to read/write STATUS.md after 20 turns from last status update.
- ACTIVE REQUEST: MUST update status and timestamp after each read.
