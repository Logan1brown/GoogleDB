# Status [2025-04-01T15:16]

Progress: (task tracking)
- Previous: Implemented multi-studio support and normalization
- Current: Completed studio data validation and normalization
- Next: Expand TMDB show matching and data integration

Implementation: (current focus)
- TMDB Integration:
  1. Current Status:
     - Studio normalization complete with validation
     - Multi-studio support implemented
     - Data validation rules in place
  2. Next Steps:
     - Match remaining shows to TMDB database
     - Import complete cast/crew data
     - Verify existing show information
     - Implement official genre system
  3. Integration Plan:
     - Identify shows without TMDB IDs
     - Use API to search and verify matches
     - Import additional show metadata
     - Update genre categorizations

Working files: (ONLY 3 current files)
1. docs/sheets/STS Sales Database - studio_list_2.csv (active updates)
2. docs/proposals/studio_name_normalization.md (reference)

Reference docs: (current task best practices)
- docs/proposals/studio_name_normalization.md (studio categories)
- docs/sheets/STS Sales Database - studio_list.csv (original data)

Specs: (current task requirements)
- Accurate studio categorization (vertically integrated vs independent)
- Consistent parent company tracking
- Complete alias coverage
- Consider performance with large result sets

Insights: (new patterns discovered)
- Layered filtering powerful for complex queries
- Primary (required) + Secondary (optional) pattern works well
- Could extend to genre + source views
- Progressive disclosure helps manage information density


Rules: (global working limits)
- Plan refactor if file > 500 lines
- Analyze full context before modifying
- Always view before editing
- ACTIVE REQUEST: MUST return to read/write STATUS.md after 20 turns from last status update.
- ACTIVE REQUEST: MUST update status and timestamp after each read.
