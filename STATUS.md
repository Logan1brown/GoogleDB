# Status [2025-04-04T23:14]

Progress: (task tracking)
- Previous: Studio component fix
- Current: Unified Dashboard View scaffolding
- Next: Add real success metrics to unified view

Implementation: (current focus)
- Basic unified dashboard structure complete
- Networks tab working with placeholder data
- Column name differences preserved ('shows' vs 'show_name')
- Error logging added to unified_analyzer.py

Working files: (ONLY 4 current files)
1. src/dashboard/components/unified_view.py
2. src/data_processing/unified/unified_analyzer.py
3. src/dashboard/app.py
4. docs/proposals/UNIFIED_DASHBOARD_VIEW.md

Reference docs: (current task best practices)
1. docs/development/STYLE_GUIDE.md (visual standards)
2. docs/development/TEMPLATE_SYSTEM.md (architecture)
3. docs/proposals/UNIFIED_DASHBOARD_VIEW.md (feature spec)

Specs: (current task requirements)
1. Maintain column name differences ('shows' vs 'show_name')
2. Follow existing success metrics patterns
3. Use persistent filters across tabs
4. Add proper error handling and logging

Insights: (new patterns discovered)
1. Using scaffolding approach - basic structure with placeholders first
2. Success metrics need tmdb_status - plan to implement this next
3. Error logging helps track data flow issues early

Rules: (global working limits)
- Plan refactor if file > 500 lines
- Analyze full context before modifying
- Always view before editing
- ACTIVE REQUEST: MUST return to read/write STATUS.md after 20 turns from last status update.
- ACTIVE REQUEST: MUST update status and timestamp after each read.
