# Status [2025-04-01T18:37]

Progress: (task tracking)
- Previous: Completed studio data validation and normalization
- Current: Starting TMDB show matching and data enhancement
- Next: Implement success metrics and episode details

Implementation: (current focus)
- TMDB Integration Phase 1:
     - Identify and match shows without TMDB IDs
     - Search API for potential matches
     - Verify and confirm matches
     - Document any unmatched shows

Working files: (ONLY 3 current files)
1. src/data_processing/external/tmdb/scripts/match_shows.py (show matching)
2. src/data_processing/external/tmdb/scripts/validate_matches.py (validation)
3. docs/sheets/STS Sales Database - shows.csv (for matching)

Reference docs: (current task best practices)
- docs/proposals/tmdb_data_integration.md (integration plan)
- docs/proposals/tmdb_success_metrics.md (metrics definition)

Specs: (current task requirements)
- Accurate show matching with TMDB database
- Proper handling of unmatched shows
- Efficient API usage within rate limits
- Data validation before updates

Insights: (new patterns discovered)
- Focus on exact title matches first
- Handle special characters in show names
- Consider year/network for disambiguation

Rules: (global working limits)
- Plan refactor if file > 500 lines
- Analyze full context before modifying
- Always view before editing
- ACTIVE REQUEST: MUST return to read/write STATUS.md after 20 turns from last status update.
- ACTIVE REQUEST: MUST update status and timestamp after each read.
