# Status [2025-04-02T16:38]

Progress: (task tracking)
- Previous: Success metrics design completion
- Current: Streamlit implementation for success metrics
- Next: Market Snapshot Integration

Implementation: (current focus)
- Streamlit dashboard components
- Success metrics visualization
- Template-based chart system

Working files: (ONLY 5 current files)
1. TASKLIST.md (sprint planning)
2. src/dashboard/templates/defaults/*.py (chart defaults)
3. src/dashboard/templates/grids/*.py (layout grids)
4. src/dashboard/utils/style_config.py (style constants)
5. src/dashboard/components/market_snapshot.py (first component)

Reference docs: (current task best practices)
1. docs/development/STYLE_GUIDE.md (visual standards)
2. docs/development/TEMPLATE_SYSTEM.md (architecture)
3. README.md (project structure)

Specs: (current task requirements)
1. Three-layer visualization system:
   - Base Template Layer (go.layout.Template)
   - Grid Layout Layer (make_subplots)
   - Style Config Layer (style_config.py)
2. Consistent styling:
   - Typography: Source Sans Pro
   - Colors: Defined in style_config.py
   - Layout: Full width, proper spacing

Insights: (new patterns discovered)
1. Template hierarchy ensures consistency
2. Grid system separates structure from style
3. Preview system validates layouts early

Rules: (global working limits)
- Plan refactor if file > 500 lines
- Analyze full context before modifying
- Always view before editing
- ACTIVE REQUEST: MUST return to read/write STATUS.md after 20 turns from last status update.
- ACTIVE REQUEST: MUST update status and timestamp after each read.
