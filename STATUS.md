# Status [2025-04-07T11:14]

Progress: (task tracking)
- Previous: Multipage App Structure Implementation
- Current: Completed all phases (1-5)
- Next: Continue with Unified Dashboard View backlog

Implementation: (current focus)
## Current Status

### Recently Completed
- Implemented multipage architecture
- Added scoped state management
- Migrated all views to standalone pages
- Verified state isolation and component reuse

### In Progress
- Planning 5-phase implementation approach
- Keeping existing components and templates
- Adding new pages/ and state/ directories

Working files: (ONLY 4 current files)
1. src/dashboard/app.py
2. docs/proposals/MULTIPAGE_APP_STRUCTURE.md
3. TASKLIST.md
4. STATUS.md

Reference docs: (current task best practices)
1. docs/proposals/MULTIPAGE_APP_STRUCTURE.md (architecture)
2. docs/development/TEMPLATE_SYSTEM.md (existing structure)
3. docs/DATA_COLUMNS.md (data naming conventions)

Specs: (current task requirements)
1. Keep existing components and templates
2. Add proper page routing and state isolation
3. Maintain column name differences ('shows' vs 'show_name')
4. Clean separation between pages and components

Insights: (new patterns discovered)
1. Pages don't replace views - they complement them
2. State needs to be scoped per page
3. Navigation logic should move from app.py to pages/

Rules: (global working limits)
- Plan refactor if file > 500 lines
- Analyze full context before modifying
- Always view before editing
- ACTIVE REQUEST: MUST return to read/write STATUS.md after 20 turns from last status update.
- ACTIVE REQUEST: MUST update status and timestamp after each read.
