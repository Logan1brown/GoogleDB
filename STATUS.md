# Status [2025-03-30T23:40]

Progress: (task tracking)
- Previous: Decided on network analysis component split
- Current: Starting Network Connections Dashboard
- Next: Extract from network_connections.py

Implementation: (current focus)
- Building two independent dashboard components:
  1. Network Connections Dashboard (Overview)
     - Force-directed graph
     - Success stories
     - High-level metrics
  2. Network Sharing Dashboard (Details) - Coming later
     - Detailed talent tables
     - Network pair analysis
- Starting with overview component

Working files: (ONLY 4 current files)
1. src/data_processing/creative_networks/network_connections.py (to split)
2. src/data_processing/creative_networks/network_sharing_analysis.py (to update)
3. src/data_processing/creative_networks/network_graph.py (to update)
4. src/data_processing/creative_networks/role_analysis.py (to refactor)

Reference docs: (current task best practices)
- docs/development/TEMPLATE_SYSTEM.md (functional style)
- docs/development/STYLE_GUIDE.md (visualization standards)
- docs/analysis/STS_ANALYSIS_FRAMEWORK.md (network metrics)

Specs: (current task requirements)
- Convert class-based code to functional style
- Split visualization from analysis logic
- Match genre/source component patterns
- Focus on network relationships and shared talent


Rules: (global working limits)
- Plan refactor if file > 500 lines
- Analyze full context before modifying
- Always view before editing
- ACTIVE REQUEST: MUST return to read/write STATUS.md after 20 turns from last status update.
- ACTIVE REQUEST: MUST update status and timestamp after each read.
