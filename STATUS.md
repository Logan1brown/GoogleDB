# Status [2025-04-02T00:06]

Progress: (task tracking)
- Previous: Completed TMDB show matching and data enhancement
- Current: Implementing TMDB success metrics pipeline
- Next: Test with sample shows and validate data

Implementation: (current focus)
- TMDB Success Metrics Phase:
    - Created two-stage pipeline:
        1. Pull TMDB data & generate CSVs
        2. Update Google Sheets with data
    - Defined exact sheet structures:
        - tmdb_success_metrics sheet columns:
            tmdb_seasons, tmdb_eps, tmdb_total_eps, tmdb_avg_eps,
            tmdb_status, tmdb_last_air, success_score
        - shows sheet updates:
            notes, order_type, status, episode_count, success_score

Working files: (ONLY 4 current files)
1. src/data_processing/external/tmdb/scripts/pull_tmdb_success_metrics.py (data pull)
2. src/data_processing/external/tmdb/scripts/update_sheets_with_tmdb.py (sheet updates)
3. src/config/sheets_config.py (sheet names)
4. TASKLIST.md (requirements)

Reference docs: (current task best practices)
- docs/proposals/tmdb_success_metrics.md (metrics definition)

Specs: (current task requirements)
- Exact column names and order in sheets
- Proper status mapping (active/development/cancelled)

Insights: (new patterns discovered)

Rules: (global working limits)
- Plan refactor if file > 500 lines
- Analyze full context before modifying
- Always view before editing
- ACTIVE REQUEST: MUST return to read/write STATUS.md after 20 turns from last status update.
- ACTIVE REQUEST: MUST update status and timestamp after each read.
